# Standardizing API Responses Without Traits
### Problem
I've noticed that most libraries created for API responses are implemented using traits, and the rest are large
libraries. These traits implement methods for everything imaginable (response, accepted, created, forbidden...).

As a result, if my controller has 1-2 methods, including such a trait brings a lot of unnecessary clutter into the
class. In a couple of large libraries with 700+ stars, I see overengineering at the UX level (for me, as a user of the
library).

### Solution
Write my own library!

I decided to create a data processing logic that would require:
* minimal actions at the user level
* simplicity of use
* readability

That is, to get a standardized response, all we need is to return a response via the library object:

```bash
composer require pepperfm/api-responder-for-laravel
```

As a result, the basic minimum we get right after installing the library is:

Successful response:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "data": {
      "entities": []|{},
      "meta": []|{},
      "message": "Success"
    }
  }
}
```

Error response:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "data": {
      "errors": null,
      "message": "Error"
    }
  }
}
```

```php
public function __construct(public ResponseContract $json)
{
}

public function index(Request $request)
{
    $users = User::query()->get();

    return $this->json->response($users);
}

public function store(UserService $service)
{
    try {
        app('db')->beginTransaction();

        $service->update(request()->input());
        
        app('db')->commit();
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        app('db')->rollback();
        logger()->debug($e->getMessage());

        return $this->json->error(
            message: $e->getMessage(),
            httpStatusCode: $e->getCode()
        );
    }

    return $this->json->response($users);
}
```

As a result, with a successful response, we have the format unpacked as: `response.data.entities`. By default, the format
is relevant in the context of REST, so for the `show()` and `update()` methods, the response will be in the format:
`response.data.entity`.

## Deep Dive
Of course, for customization enthusiasts and configuration explorers, I also created a code sandbox to play around with.

### Features
#### Our Favorite Sugar
A wrapper over the `response()` method for pagination:

```php
/*
 * Generate response.data.meta.pagination from first argument of `paginated()` method
 */
public function index(Request $request)
{
  $users = User::query()->paginate();

  return $this->json->paginated($users);
}
```

The `paginated()` method accepts two main parameters:

```php
array|\Illuminate\Pagination\LengthAwarePaginator $data,
array|\Illuminate\Pagination\LengthAwarePaginator $meta = [],
```

In its logic, it resolves them and adds them to the response under the `meta` key â€” pagination key.

Response interfaces according to the format returned by Laravel:
```typescript
export interface IPaginatedResponse<T> {
    current_page: number
    per_page: number
    last_page: number
    data: T[]
    from: number
    to: number
    total: number
    prev_page_url?: any
    next_page_url: string
    links: IPaginatedResponseLinks[]
}
export interface IPaginatedResponseLinks {
    url?: any
    label: string
    active: boolean
}
```

As a result, the response looks like:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "data": {
      "entities": []|{},
      "meta": {
        "pagination": IPaginatedResponse<T>
      },
      "message": "Success"
    }
  }
}
```

A wrapper over the `response()` method for status codes:

```php
public function store(UserService $service)
{
    // message: 'Stored', httpStatusCode: JsonResponse::HTTP_CREATED
    return $this->json->stored();
}

public function destroy()
{
    // message: 'Deleted', httpStatusCode: JsonResponse::HTTP_NO_CONTENT
    return $this->json->deleted();
}
```

#### Working with Different Parameter Types
The first argument of the response() method can be of types array|Arrayable, so data can be mapped before passing to the
method within these types. For example:

```php
public function index()
{
    $users = User::query()->paginate();
    $dtoCollection = $users->getCollection()->mapInto(UserDto::class);

    return resolve(ResponseContract::class)->paginated(
        data: $dtoCollection,
        meta: $users
    );
}
```

```php
public function index()
{
    $users = SpatieUserData::collect(User::query()->get());

    return \ApiBaseResponder::response($users);
}
```

#### Customization via Config
The config itself:

```php
return [
    'plural_data_key' => 'entities',

    'singular_data_key' => 'entity',

    'using_for_rest' => true,

    'methods_for_singular_key' => ['show', 'update'],

    'force_json_response_header' => true,
];
```

Disabling `using_for_rest` keeps the returned format always `response.data.entities` (plural) regardless of the method from
which the call is made.

With `methods_for_singular_key`, you can add to the list of methods where the key will be returned in the singular.
`force_json_response_header` essentially adds the header to requests in the classic way: `$request->headers->set('Accept', 'application/json');`
#### Customization via Attributes
Blocking `using_for_rest` and `methods_for_singular_key` values in the config to set the response key according to
`singular_data_key`:

```php
#[ResponseDataKey]
public function attributeWithoutParam(): JsonResponse
{
    // response.data.entity
    return BaseResponse::response($this->user);
}
```

Similarly, you can pass your own key name:

```php
#[ResponseDataKey('random_key')]
public function attributeWithParam(): JsonResponse
{
    // response.data.random_key
    return BaseResponse::response($this->user);
}
```

### In Conclusion
The main need is covered: I wanted to be able to simply install the library and have a concise basis for standardizing
the response format out of the box. Without unnecessary movements.

And of course, there are still plenty of opportunities for customization and additional sugar, so further development of
the library lies ahead) but the main idea will definitely be preserved.
